# DEVTA DAO

## ABOUT
This is the decentralized autonomous organization for the users to manage the treasury of the DAO and members to donate the money to the works for the Dharmik works like temple buildings, etc. 

Firstly the user has to connect the wallet then mint the nft of Ganesh which is ERC1155 for entering the DAO for free only limited people has the access to the DAO.

This DAO has it's own treasury of LAKSHMI ERC20 coins.

Then the users can vote for the proposals, when all the users will vote the contract will automatically execute.

For this project I used the Thirdweb SDK for contract writing, deploying and managing. Also, for frontend I use React.
